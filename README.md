# Historical_Crypto
The Historical Crypto Trading Data Analysis 
Project examines past data of cryptocurrencies to uncover trading patterns and trends. By utilizing data analysis and visualization techniques, it provides valuable insights in the cryptocurrency market. 
In the first part of the project, i prepared,cleaned and modified the data, in order to analyse it
Furthermore, i tried to answer these 5 questions, which were interesting to me, regarding the project





## Questions:
1) What are the general trends in cryptocurrency prices over time?
2) What is the correlation between bitcoin and alt coin prices?
3) Which currencies are the most volatile?
4) Which cryptocurrency had the highest price appreciation or depreciation?
5) Are there any notable patterns or trends in trading volumes over time?

import seaborn as sns
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook files in the `notebooks/` directory using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the code cells in the notebooks sequentially to perform the analysis.
5. The output visualizations and summary reports will be saved in the `results/` directory.
